At first, I solved questions on the underneath websites and then just uploaded those to this `repo`, however, now, instead of just pushing python soulutions, I put the explaination of those practices and the methods that I used to solve the problem(s) using `jupyter-notebook`.

If you are new to python, then let me tell you some basic glossary. Any line with a # before it is treated as a comment. Comments are a great way of communicating with the viewers of the code and help them understand the code better. Also suppose if you look at your own projects after a long time, then you yourself will be able to understand the code and make improvements to it or add more methods of solving the same problem.
